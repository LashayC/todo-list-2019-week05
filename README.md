# To-Do List
This is a to-do list madde for tracking your goals. You can add, cross-out, and remove list items from it as needed to stay organized.

## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

To build this I first focused on creating constants for variables I would be using to reference the DOM. From there I focused on creating functions that followed how the user would be interacting with the code. This allowed me start with creating a function that would create li elements in the DOM. Next was the function to click on an li to cross out an item. From there it was a button to clear crossed out items and finally was a button to clear all at once. Moving in this order not only kept the code cohesive and organized, it also made easier to stay on task as I tackled each function. 

## Lessons Learned:
No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those whoa this is awesome or fuck yeah I did it! moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.

With this project I was able to great experience manipulating the DOM using Javascript and using childnodes. It pushed me to use new syntax for referncing the DOM eg childnodes and involved referencing the event's object throughout.


## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:

**Slot Machine:** https://github.com/Resilient-Labs/slot-machine-2019-week05

I completed the challenge: 5
I feel good about my code: 4
I'm not sure if my constructors are setup cleanly
